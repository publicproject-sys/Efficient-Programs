# Efficient Magic Hexagon Solver

This project presents an optimized solver for the Magic Hexagon puzzle, developed as part of the "Efficient Programs WS23/24" [Course website](https://tiss.tuwien.ac.at/course/courseDetails.xhtml?dswid=3475&dsrid=44&courseNr=185190&semester=2024W&locale=en) course. The primary objective was to identify inefficiencies in the initial program, implement a series of optimizations, and measure their impact on performance. The focus was on microoptimizations and hardware-level efficiency improvements, while ensuring the core algorithm remained effective. The achieved speed-up was around x93.


The results are summarized by the PowerPoint presentation given by the file "Presentation.pptx".
